## Overview
This repository
- is the home of the source code of conda-forge's documentation.
- provides an [issue tracker](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues) for conda-forge related questions and issues that are **not specific to individual feedstocks**.

If you have questions or need help, please check out our documentation for a [list of ways to interact with us](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/how_to_get_help.html).

## Improving the docs

- You can help to improve the documentation! It is version-controlled in the [conda-forge.github.io repository on GitHub](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io).   The source text is stored in the src/ subdirectory and is formatted using Pythonâ€™s [reStructuredText system](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).

- The docs are built on GitHub Actions and run the `.ci_scripts/update_docs` script.
  We are glad to know that you would like to contribute. To build the docs locally, follow the steps mentioned below:
1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [conda-forge.github.io](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io)        repository to your own GitHub user account.
2.  [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this fork onto your computer.
3.  Go into the main folder. </br>
    Run the following commands.  
      *  `conda env create -f ./.ci_scripts/environment.yml`
      *  `conda activate conda-forge-docs`
      *  `cd newsfeed && pip install --no-deps .`
      *  `cd ../src`
      *  `make html`
4.  Make and commit your changes.
5.  Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the main repository proposing your changes.

## conda-forge dev meetings

We hold biweekly meetings every second Wednesday from 17:00-18:00 (UTC). Feel free to stop by!
Up-to-date invites are always available in the [conda.org community calendar](https://conda.org/community/calendar). Look for the `[conda-forge] core meeting` events!

Our [meeting notes](https://conda-forge.org/docs/orga/minutes/00_intro.html) record important points discussed during the meetings and serve as a record for upcoming meetings. We make use of [HackMd](https://hackmd.io/) and a [template](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/misc/DEV_MEETING_TEMPLATE.md) to create the meeting notes.

We use a Github Actions [workflow][gha-workflow] to create an automated PR with the meeting notes
template for each session, which is automatically published to our HackMD team account. During the
meeting, attendees will edit the HackMD document. After the meeting, the document is saved and the
PR is synced with the changes by adding the `sync-hackmd-notes` label. Once satisfied, the PR is
merged and the website will be updated with the new meeting notes.

We encourage contributors to join the meetings and learn more about and from the community.
