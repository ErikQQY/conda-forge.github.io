### Standing items

- [ ] DJC conda-forge default build containers should always have the latest glibc/sysroot package that we publish
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6283#issuecomment-2453101928
    - defaulting to the latest os makes os_version irrelevant for most users because glibc backward compatability
    - glibc constraint still set by sysroot package at build time; this package can lag behind syroot in container
