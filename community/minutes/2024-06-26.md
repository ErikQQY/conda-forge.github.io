### Your __new__() agenda items

- [x] (WV) Can we merge the conda-smithy / rattler-build PR?
      https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/1876
- [x] (DG) Anaconda.org website features EOL - Environments, Notebooks, Projects - Aug 24, 2024
- [x] (IF) Combined R 4.4 and MinGW UCRT migration
- [x] (FF) Use Python 3.x on host and Python >=3.x when building noarch packages. We are getting tons of issues like https://github.com/conda-forge/urllib3-feedstock/issues/84 as Python is released more frequently and b/c the bot does not use grayskull to update Python, only the other dependencies.
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2210

suggestion:
```yaml
requirements:
  host:
    - python 3.8.*
  run:
    # option 1
    - python >=3.8
    # option 2
    - {{ pin_compatible("python", max_pin=None) }}
test:
  requires:
    - python 3.8.*
```

current:
```yaml
requirements:
  host:
    - python >=3.8
  run:
    - python >=3.8
```
